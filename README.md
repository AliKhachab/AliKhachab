# A little about me

My name is Ali, and although it's my second year in college, I'm currently a CS junior studying in my hometown NYC, where I was born and raised.


I'm currently learning frontend development, starting with the basics in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After that, I plan on learning Next.js, Node.js and React, and possibly using these skills to start making a website for myself or for general use. For now, I'll keep dumping the small projects I'm working on 
here.

Things I'm learning:
- Frontend development [(from his courses, for those interested)](https://www.youtube.com/@ByteGrad), in this planned order:

  1) HTML
  2) CSS
  3) JavaScript
  4) React, Next.js, and TypeScript
  5) Making my own personal project

- Backend development
  
  1) Will update with whichever frameworks, languages, etc. I use when I get to it


Things I've learned:

 - Java
 - Python ([improving this with research in school!](https://github.com/GuangWeiToo/InteractiveMapWebsite))
 - Git
 - Object oriented programming
 - Data structures
