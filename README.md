# A little about me

My name is Ali, and I'm a rising senior in Computer Science. I currently have a SWE/consultancy co-op, where I am learning .NET Core and Microsoft related technologies along with SQL and database management.

As for my self-studying, I'm currently learning frontend development, starting with the basics in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After that, I plan on learning Next.js, Node.js and React, and possibly using these skills to start making a website for myself or for general use. For now, I'll keep dumping the small projects I'm working on here.

Things I'm learning:
- Frontend development ([from ByteGrad's courses](https://www.youtube.com/@ByteGrad)), in this planned order:

  1) HTML ✅ 
  2) CSS and SCSS -- ✅ 
  3) JavaScript -- 75% complete
  4) React, Next.js, and TypeScript -- Started using React at hackathons!
  5) Making my own personal project
  6) Trying what I've learned at a hackathon  ✅
  7) C#/XAML/WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) ✅ (Learned at co-op)

- Backend development

  1) SQL and Databases ✅ (Learned at co-op, continuing in school)
  2) Will update more as I learn more about backend
